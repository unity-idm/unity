=== Access with well-known URLs

Endpoint type:: +WellKnownLinksHandler+
Binding:: Web (Vaadin)
Exposed paths:: +/sec+

This endpoint is providing access to various Unity functions which are accessible via well known URLs and,
at the same time, require authentication to be used. Analogous feature but for cases not requiring authentication
is exposed always under the +/unitygw+ reserved path.

Currently the endpoint offers a single feature but there are plans to extend it in future. The endpoint
does not require any custom configuration.
