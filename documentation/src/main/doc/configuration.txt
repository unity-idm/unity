== General server configuration

The server uses two main configuration files: +conf/unityServer.conf+ and +conf/log4j.properties+. To change 
their default locations one needs to edit startup scripts. 

The +conf/log4j.properties+ file configures the logging of the server. This is described in the section <<logging>>.

The +conf/unityServer.conf+ file is the main server configuration file. All other configuration files are defined 
in it.

=== Credentials and truststores

The server credential, used in the first place to setup the TLS server socket is configured with the 
following properties. The simple example is:

include::sec-ref-credProperties.txt[]




include::sec-ref-trustProperties.txt[]

=== Logging configuration

Unity uses the Log4j logging framework in version 1.2.x (note that the latest version 2.x is much different).
What is more the log4j-extras package is included so additional logging features are enabled. 
Logging is configured in the +conf/log4j.properties+ file.

[NOTE]
===========
You can change the logging configuration at runtime by editing the +conf/log4j.properties+ file.
The new configuration will take effect a few seconds after the file has been modified.
===========

By default, log files are written to the the +logs/+ directory. 

The following example config file configures logging so that log files are 
rotated daily, compressed.

-------------------
# The default log level and the output (appender)
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, LOGFILE

# What to log
log4j.logger.net.sf.ehcache=WARN
log4j.logger.org.springframework=WARN
log4j.logger.org.eclipse.jetty=INFO
log4j.logger.unity.server=DEBUG
log4j.logger.unity.server.config=INFO
log4j.logger.org.apache=INFO
log4j.logger.pl.edu.icm=DEBUG
log4j.logger.pl.edu.icm.unity.db.mapper=INFO


#Configuration of appenders which performs actual logging

# LOGFILE is set to be a file appender using a PatternLayout with daily rolling.
log4j.appender.LOGFILE=org.apache.log4j.rolling.RollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.LOGFILE.RollingPolicy=org.apache.log4j.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy
log4j.appender.LOGFILE.RollingPolicy.FileNamePattern=logs/unity-server.log.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.gz
log4j.appender.LOGFILE.File=logs/unity-server.log
log4j.appender.LOGFILE.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.LOGFILE.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} [%t] %-5p %c %x - %m%n
-------------------

[NOTE]
===========
In Log4j, the log rotation frequency is controlled by the DatePattern. Check 
http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/DailyRollingFileAppender.html
for the details.
===========

For more info on controlling the logging we refer to the log4j documentation:
  
  - http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/PatternLayout.html[PatternLayout]
  
  - http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/RollingFileAppender.html[RollingFileAppender]
  
  - http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/DailyRollingFileAppender.html[DailyRollingFileAppender]
  
 
Log4j supports a very wide range of logging options, such as date based or size based file rollover,
logging different things to different files and much more. For full information on Log4j we refer to
the publicly available documentation, for example the 
http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html[Log4j manual].
 

=== Logger categories, names and levels

Logger names are hierarchical. In Unity, prefixes are used (e.g. "unity.server.con") 
to which the Java class name is appended. The most common logging prefixes are:

- +unity.server+ - general server messages
- +unity.server.config+ - configuration parsing and loading
- +unity.server.db+ - database related
- +unity.server.web+ - web interface related
- +unity.server.saml+ - SAML subsystem related
- +unity.server.ldap+ - upstream LDAP IdP related 
- +unity.server.ws+ - SOAP (web service) stack related
- +unity.server.externaltranslation+ - messages connected with the translation of any upstream IdP 
data to the Unity format.
 

Therefore the logging output produced can be controlled in a fine-grained manner. 
Log levels in Log4j are (in increasing level of severity): 

# +TRACE+ on this level _huge_ pieces of unprocessed information are dumped,
# +DEBUG+ admin-friendly, verbose information, useful for hunting problems, 
# +INFO+ standard information, not much output,
# +WARN+ warnings are logged when something went wrong (so it should be investigated), but recovery was possible,
# +ERROR+ something went wrong and operation probably failed, 
# +FATAL+ something went really wrong - this is used very rarely for critical situations like overall server failure.

For example, to debug a configuration problem, you can set:
  
------
log4j.logger.unity.server.config=DEBUG
------

[NOTE]
===========
The best way to discover what is the name of interesting category is turn on the general DEBUG logging 
for a while. Then interesting events can be seen and subsequently the logging configuration can be fine tuned
to only show them.
