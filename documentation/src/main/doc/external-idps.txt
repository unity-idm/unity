== Integration of 3rd party Identity Providers

Unity can use external services to authenticate its own clients. This way Unity can act as an
authentication hub (many authentication options are offered in a single place) and as an 
authentication bridge (Unity client can use different authentication protocol then the 
protocol of the upstream IdP).

_External IdPs are configured as specialized authenticators which outsource credential verification to 
the upstream service. So this section treats about the configuration of external authenticators._

Data from external IdPs is accessed in a protocol specific way. The configuration of this
part is described in the following subsections. After the protocol specific part, a common process 
for all external IdP types take place: translation of the obtained data to the internal Unity 
representation. This "mapping" can handle both semantical and syntactical differences of the 
identity-related information. Configuration of this process is described in <<input-translation>>.
