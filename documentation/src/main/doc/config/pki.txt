==== PKI/X.509 trust settings

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) trust settings are used to validate certificates, i.e. to check if the certificate
are not faked. This is performed, in the first place when a connection with a remote peer is initiated over 
the network, using the SSL (or TLS) protocol. Additionally certificate validation can happen in few other 
situations, e.g. when checking digital signatures of various sensitive pieces of data.

Certificates validation is primarily configured using a set of initially trusted certificates of so called 
Certificate Authorities (CAs). Those trusted certificates are also known as _trust anchors_ and their collection
is called a _trust store_.

Except of _trust anchors_ validation mechanism can use additional input for checking if a certificate being checked 
was not revoked and if its subject is in a permitted namespace.

Unity allows for different types of trust stores. All of them are configured using a set of properties.

 - _Keystore trust store_ - trusted certificates are
 stored in a single binary file in the JKS or PKCS12 format. The file can be manipulated using a special tool
 like JDK +keytool+ or +openssl+ (in case of PKCS12 format). This format is a good choice if the trust store 
 should be stored in a single file or when compatibility with other Java solutions is desired.   
 - _OpenSSL trust store_ - allows to use a directory with CA certificates stored in PEM format, under precisely
 defined names: the CA certificates, CRLs, signing policy files and namespaces files are named 
 +<hash>.0+, +<hash>.r0+, +<hash>.signing_policy+ and +<hash>.namespaces+. 
 The hash must be generated using the +openssl+ tool from a trusted certificate. 
 This format is used by many well known servers, Linux distributions often provide tools
 to help in trust store management. Therefore this format is suggested if reuse of the truststore is needed.
 - _Directory trust store_ - the most flexible and convenient option, suggested for all remaining cases. It allows
 administrators to use a list of wildcard expressions, concrete paths of files or even URLs to remote files 
 as a set of trusted CAs and corresponding CRLs. With this trust store it is trivial to configure a
 designated directory(-ies) as a trust store.
 
In all cases trust stores can be (and by default are) configured to be automatically refreshed. 
 
The following table provides a reference to settings of all of the trust stores. Note that the prefix of the
+pki.properties+ is not shown in the table.

*Examples*

Directory trust store, with a minimal set of options:

 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.type=directory
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.directoryLocations.1=/trust/dir/*.pem
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.crlLocations=/trust/dir/*.crl
 
Directory trust store, with a complete set of options:

 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.type=directory
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.allowProxy=DENY
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.updateInterval=1234
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.directoryLocations.1=/trust/dir/*.pem
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.directoryLocations.2=http://caserver/ca.pem
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.directoryEncoding=PEM
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.directoryConnectionTimeout=100
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.directoryDiskCachePath=/tmp
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.crlLocations.1=/trust/dir/*.crl
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.crlLocations.2=http://caserver/crl.pem
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.crlUpdateInterval=400
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.crlMode=REQUIRE
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.crlConnectionTimeout=200
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.crlDiskCachePath=/tmp

Java keystore used as a trust store:

 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.type=keystore
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.keystorePath=/trust/truststore.jks
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.keystoreFormat=JKS
 unity.pki.truststores.MAIN.keystorePassword=xxxxxx

==== Configuring the PKI credential

Unity uses private key and a corresponding certificate (called together as a _credential_) 
to identify itself to its clients during TLS connection and sometimes to digitally sign returned documents. 
This allows clients to be sure that they are talking with the genuine, not faked peer. 
Note that also clients or users may use certificates to identify themselves to Unity - this is another topic.  

[NOTE]
Do not confuse the _PKI credential_ used by the server to identify itself with the credentials of the
entities handled in the Unity's database.

[NOTE]
For production usage, Unity should use a certificate issued by a globally trusted certificate authority.

Credentials might be provided in several formats:

 - Credential can be obtained from a _keystore file_, encoded in JKS or PKCS12 format.  
 - Credential can be loaded as a pair of PEM files (one with private key and another with certificate),
 - or from a pair of DER files,
 - or even from a single file, with PEM-encoded certificates and private key (in any order).  

The following table list all parameters which allows for configuring the credential.
Note that nearly all settings are optional. If not defined, the format is guessed.
However, some credential formats require additional settings. For instance, if using the _der_ format,
the _keyPath_ is mandatory as you need two DER files: one with a certificate and one with a key (and
the latter path can not be guessed). Note that the prefix of the +pki.properties+ configuration is not 
shown in the table.

include::../sec-ref-credProperties.txt[]

*Examples*

Credential as a pair of DER files:

 unity.pki.credentials.MAIN.format=der
 unity.pki.credentials.MAIN.password=SOME PASS
 unity.pki.credentials.MAIN.path=/etc/credentials/cert-1.der
 unity.pki.credentials.MAIN.keyPath=/etc/credentials/pk-1.der

Credential as a JKS file (credential type can be autodetected in almost every case):

 unity.pki.credentials.MAIN.path=/etc/credentials/server1.jks
 unity.pki.credentials.MAIN.password=xxxxxx

==== Configuring 3rd party certificates

Some Unity subsystems require an access to a 3rd party service certificate, e.g. to check a digital signature
issued by such service. The configuration of such 'standalone' certificates is done as follows:

 unity.pki.certificates.SOME-SERVICE-CERT.certificateFile=/etc/credentials/someServiceCert.pem
 
The certificate must be stored in a PEM file. The above configuration defines a certificate, which can be used in 
all Unity subsystems with the simple name +SOME-SERVICE-CERT+.
