=== Web SAML SSO endpoint

Endpoint type:: +SAMLWebIdP+
Binding:: Web
Exposed paths:: +/saml2idp-web+, +/metadata+, +/SLO-WEB+, +/SLO-SOAP+

This endpoint exposes the SAML 2 authentication interface, implementing the SSO profile with the support for 
the SAML HTTP-POST and HTTP-Redirect bindings.

The endpoint first authenticates the redirected client, then presents a confirmation screen
where a user can review and alter a returned information and, after acceptance, redirects the user 
to the SAML Service Provider with a SAML response.

The metadata related features and configuration is the same as in the case of remote SAML authenticator 
(<<saml-metadata>>) with the exception that the metadata is published under the endpoint's address with 
the constant +/metadata+ suffix.

The endpoint can be configured to support arbitrary SAML identity type names. By default the following 
identity type mappings are used:

[cols="m,m" options="header"]
|=== 
|SAML name 													| UNITY identity type  
|urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent 		| targetedPersistent 
|urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:X509SubjectName 	| x500Name
|urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient 		| transient
|urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified 		| targetedPersistent
|unity:persistent 											| persistent
|unity:identifier 											| identifier
|unity:userName 											| userName
|===

It is possible to reconfigure the mappings in the configuration or to add a new one. For example 
the following snippet will map the SAML identity type +userId+ to the Unity +userName+ identity type:

----
unity.saml.identityMapping.1.localIdentity=userName
unity.saml.identityMapping.1.samlIdntity=userId
----

The options of the endpoint (besides the standard options for all Web endpoints) are:

[[endp-ws-saml]]
=== Web Service SAML SOAP endpoint

Endpoint type:: +SAMLSoapIdP+
Binding:: Web Service (CXF)
Exposed paths:: +/saml2idp-soap+, +/metadata+

This endpoint exposes the SAML 2 authentication interface, exposing the functionality of the 
Attribute Query and Authentication SAML protocols over the SAML SOAP binding.

The SAML options and metadata notes are the same as in the case of the <<endp-web-saml>>.

=== SAML PAOS Enhanced Client or Proxy (ECP) endpoint

Endpoint type:: +SAML-ECP+
Binding:: _none_ (this endpoint doesn't use authenticators thus there is no binding in Unity sense. Formally it is HTTP/PAOS.)
Exposed paths:: +/saml2-ecp+

SAML ECP endpoint is a helper endpoint for non web browser clients,
which want to authenticate for using Unity interfaces (e.g. to perform SAML attribute queries), however the
authentication should be performed with a remote SAML IdP. In other words this endpoint is non-web browser client 
friendly counterpart of the Web SAML SSO endpoint. The details of the ECP are described in the 
SAML ECP profile: http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/saml-ecp/v2.0/cs01/saml-ecp-v2.0-cs01.html.

As the only function of the endpoint is to actually authenticate the client, it is not using any of regular 
Unity authenticators (none is matching this endpoint).

After successful ECP authentication against this endpoint, the client receives a JWT credential which can be used
to authenticate it against other Unity endpoints.

Configuration of the ECP endpoints is the same as the configuration of the remote SAML authenticator
(see <<external-saml>>) as ECP endpoint is in fact a relaying party (SP in SAML terminology) for remote IdPs.
However there are the following things to note:

. The ECP endpoint must have additional settings configuring JWT generation. Those are the same as the 
settings for <<endp-rest-jwt>>, however the prefix is +unity.saml.requester.jwt.+.
. The ECP endpoint always uses the *default* settings for signing the request and of the requested SAML format. 
This is because the target IdP is not known during SAML query generation.

An example configuration:

----
unity.saml.requester.requesterEntityId=http://ecpSP.example.com
unity.saml.requester.metadataPath=metadata
unity.saml.requester.remoteIdp.1.address=http://localhost:52443/
unity.saml.requester.remoteIdp.1.samlId=http://example-saml-idp.org
unity.saml.requester.remoteIdp.1.certificate=MAIN
unity.saml.requester.remoteIdp.1.translationProfile=testP 
unity.saml.requester.jwt.credential=MAIN
unity.saml.requester.jwt.tokenTtl=10
