=== User home endpoint

Endpoint type:: +UserHomeUI+
Binding:: Web
Exposed paths:: +/home+
Default path:: +/home+

Web User Home UI provides a simple profile management interface for the ordinary Unity members.
It is possible to change preferences, update credentials and check information stored in the Unity database
about the user.
  
By default it is accessible under the link: +pass:[https://localhost:2443/ENDPOINT-CONFIGURED-CONTEXT/home]+  
or simply +pass:[https://localhost:2443/ENDPOINT-CONFIGURED-CONTEXT]+ as the +/home+ path is the default.

Note that the Web Admin endpoint incorporates all the features of the of the Home endpoint (accessible
after switching the view with the _profile_ button).

The endpoint offers couple of options, which can be used to fine tune the information presented in its
interface. All options common to all web endpoints are naturally also supported. The remaining options
are provided below:

==== User modification of personal data


The following configuration snippet will enable display of the +email+ attribute of the root group
in the profile page. What's more the user will be allowed to edit the email attribute if only the attribute type
is marked as self modifiable.
 
----
unity.userhome.attributes.2.attribute=email
unity.userhome.attributes.2.group=/
unity.userhome.attributes.2.showGroup=false
unity.userhome.attributes.2.editable=true
----

For verifiable attributes (like email or mobile telephone number) Unity requires user to edit so that 
always at least one value is confirmed. This means that in order to allow users to perform self-modifications of 
their verifiable attributes, the corresponding attribute type must accept at least 2 values. 
User then is able to first add an additional attribute value (e.g. another email), then confirm it 
and finally remove an old one.
