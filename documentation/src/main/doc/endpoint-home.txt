Web User Home UI provides a simple profile management interface for the ordinary Unity members.
It is possible to change preferences, update credentials and check information stored in the Unity database

By default it is accessible under the link: +pass:[https://localhost:2443/ENDPOINT-CONFIGURED-CONTEXT/home]+  
or simply +pass:[https://localhost:2443/ENDPOINT-CONFIGURED-CONTEXT]+ as the +/home+ path is the default.

after switching the view with the _profile_ button).

The endpoint offers couple of options, which can be used to fine tune the information presented in its
interface. All options common to all web endpoints are naturally also supported. The remaining options
