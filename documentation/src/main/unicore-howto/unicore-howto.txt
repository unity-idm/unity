== Introduction

This guide describes how to integrate http://unicore.eu[UNICORE Grid middleware] with Unity.

Unity is an optional element for UNICORE (i.e. UNICORE can be used without Unity), however quite often is the 
solution of choice as provides the most complete support for the following use-cases:

* Users can access UNICORE without X.509 certificate, which is otherwise a requirement (aka _certificate-less access_).
* Unity can serve as common authentication provider for UNICORE Portal, UNICORE Rich Client (URC) and 
UNICORE Command Line Client (UCC).
* Unity can serve as an authentication provider for RESTful clients of the UNICORE middleware.
* Unity can serve as an advanced attribute provider (AIP in UNICRE terminology) for UNICORE servers, replacing XUUDB -- 
the default, simple service.

In general it is the most convenient to use Unity as a central and only point of UNICORE users management.

There are numerous scenarios and variants in which UNICORE can be used, here we provide a description of the most
important ones.

== Using Unity with host OS authentication

In this scenario Unity will be configured to support all UNICORE use-cases, authenticating UNICORE users with their
UNIX of the machine hosting Unity. This scenario is relevant when UNICORE is a remote access service for 
a single HPC cluster. It is rather not useful in a multi-site deployment, as then typically there are different 
users on different machines (of course Unity can be used in such scenario but the PAM authentication is not useful then). 

=== With demo certificates

UNICORE provide a quickstart distribution which allows admins for super-easy deployment of the stack, which is great for
experimentation. Unity integrates seamlessly with UNICORE quickstart, allowing one to start playing with UNICORE
quickly.

The downside of using the quickstart deployment is that out of the box an insecure server certificates are used. 
The next section provides an instruction how to replace the demo certificates with secure ones. 

. *Install Unity* -- Download the latest tar.gz distribution of Unity from 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/unity-idm/files/Unity%20server[Unity downloads site], and unpack it in 
the installation directory of choice.
. *Enable UNICORE support with PAM* -- In the +conf/unityServer.conf+ file search for a commented line 
starting with +$include.unicoreWithPam+ and uncomment it (i.e. remove the leading +#+ and any spaces). You will find
it  towards the end of the file in the _Modules_ section. 
. *Enable UNICORE demo certificates support* -- In the same +conf/unityServer.conf+ file uncomment another line,
starting with +$include.unicoreDemo+.
. *Configure PAM* -- Create a PAM facility for Unity. The facility should be named +unity+, i.e. should be in  
a file +/etc/pam.d/unity+. Use any PAM authentication requirements you prefer, e.g. the same one which is used 
for local authentication to the system. Note that if you use the +pam_unix+ module (authentication against the standard 
+/etc/shadow+ passwords DB), then the user which is running Unity must be able to read the shadow file.
See <<manual.txt#pam-authenticator,Unity documentation>> for more details. 
. *Start Unity* -- Run +bin/unity-idm-server-start+ script. Check the +logs/*+ for any startup problems.

=== Basic administration

After configuring Unity it may be needed to perform some fine tuning or inspect things. Most of those operations is
performed from the Unity Admin UI. It is available by default under +https://your.host.org:2443/admin+ address. 
Login with the user name +admin+ and password +the!unity+. You will be prompted to change the default password. 

In the main panel you will see the hierarchy of groups with your users (all UNICORE users will appear in proper group
after using the system) and server(s).

. *How to change Unity network settings?* By default server listens on all interfaces on the +2443+ port. 
Update those settings in the network section of the +conf/unityServer.conf+. Make sure to also properly set 
the advertised address (this must be the address that external clients are using when accessing Unity). 
. *How to limit UNICORE access to members of a particular Unix group?* Open the 
+conf/modules/unicore/tr-hostOS2UNICORE.json+ file, find the condition of the first rule there. Change its value
from +true+ to +groups contains 'mygroup'+, putting your desired UNIX group there.  


=== From demo certificates to production 

If the infrastructure works well with the demo certificates, before going into production the secure certificates 
needs to be installed -- both for Unity and UNICORE. Unity must be also aware of the certificate used by UNICORE
so it is authorized to perform required read operations.

First of all remove the insecure demo certificates:

. *Remove trust to the Demo CA* -- Remove the file +conf/pki/trusted-ca/unicore-demoCA.pem+.
. *Remove the demo certificate of Unity server* -- Remove the file +conf/pki/demoKeystore.p12+.
. *Remove the authorization of Demo UNICORE server* -- Login to Unity Admin panel, select in the identities list the 
line with name _UNICORE_ and remove it (the _Delete entity_ operation).
. *Turn off the UNICORE demo configuration module* -- Comment the line starting with +$include.unicoreDemo+ in the 
+conf/unityServer.conf+ file.

Now the production certificates needs to be installed:

. *Install the proper CA* -- if you use a custom CA for UNICORE deployment put the CA certificate file in 
the +conf/pki/trusted-ca/+ directory, making sure that it has extension (and format) +.pem+. You can also put multiple 
CA file there. Otherwise, if a more complex trust settings are needed (e.g. machine's openssl truststore should be used, 
or the default Java truststore or any other schema), please see the <<manual.txt#server_trust,Unity documentation>> 
for possible truststore configuration options. The truststore type and parameters are configured in 
the +conf/pki.properties+ file.
. *Install Unity server certificate* put your keystore PKCS12 file with server's certificate and private key in
the +conf/pki/+ directory and in the file +conf/pki.properties+ set its name, password and key alias in the credential
section. In case when other then PKCS12 credential format is used (e.g. Java's JKS or a pair of PEM files) see 
the <<manual.txt#server_cred,Unity documentation>> for possible options.
. *Authorize the production UNICORE server to use Unity* -- Login to Unity Admin panel, and select 
the +/unicore/servers+ group in the groups browser. Invoke the _add entity_ action. In the dialog select the 
X500 identity format and either paste the DN of the production UNICORE server, or upload the certificate. 
Leave other settings with their defaults.

Make sure to restart the server.

== Configuring UNICORE to use Unity

In order to configure UNICORE quickstart distribution to use Unity the following steps should be performed:

. *Installation pre-configuration* -- When configuring UNICORE installation in the +configure.properties+ file,
make sure to set the +xuudb+ and +installdemocerts+ properties to +false+. Everything else including UNICORE 
installation shall be performed in a regular way.
. *Changes in Gateway configuration* -- Add the following line to the +gateway.properties+ file: 
+gateway.httpServer.requireClientAuthn=false+.
. *Changes in UNICORE/X uas.config*
.. Set +container.security.attributes.order=VO-PULL+.
.. Set +container.security.rest.authentication.order=UNITY+.
.. Uncomment three lines with properties starting with +container.security.rest.authentication.UNITY.+.
.. Update the host and port in +container.security.rest.authentication.UNITY.address+ property to match your 
Unity installation. Note that the default URL path is fine.
. *Update of the vo.config of UNICORE/X* -- use the following configuration as a template, updating +localhost:2443+
in the +vo.voServerURI+ and +vo.pull.voServerURL+ properties to proper address of Unity server.
