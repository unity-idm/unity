# Project Guidelines

## General Code Style

* Indentation: use tabs.
* Opening bracket ({) placement: new line. At the same time do not add additional line between brackets and code.
* Closing bracket (}) placement: new line.

## Development of tests

* Naming of test cases: should??? or shouldNot???, written in camel case.
* In rare cases underscore is permitted to strongly separate some variants, but this should be pretty rare.
* Use Junit 5
* Use Mockito for mocking
* Use AssertJ for assertions
* Both Unit and integration tests should have 'Test' as the last word in class name.
