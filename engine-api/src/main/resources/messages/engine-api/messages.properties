AttributeStatementMVELContextKey.idsByType=Map indexed with identity types. Each entry is a list with all identities of the entity.
AttributeStatementMVELContextKey.attrs=Map indexed with regular attribute names of the current group. Value of each entry is a list of the attribute values.
AttributeStatementMVELContextKey.attr=Map indexed with regular attribute names of the current group. Value of each entry is a single value of the attribute. If the attribute is multi-valued then the first value is returned. If the attribute has no value then empty string is returned.
AttributeStatementMVELContextKey.eattrs= As attrs but with attributes of the extra group (only available if extra group is defined).

AttributeStatementMVELContextKey.entityId=The identifier (numeric) of the entity.


EntityMVELContextKey.idsByType=Map of identity values indexed by type.
EntityMVELContextKey.idsByTypeObj= Map of identity values indexed by type. Here values are full objects, what is useful to check for instance confirmation status of an email.
EntityMVELContextKey.attrs=Map indexed with attribute names. Value of each entry is a list of the attribute values.
EntityMVELContextKey.attr=Map indexed with names of attribute in the / group. Value of each entry is a single value of the attribute. If the attribute is multi-valued then the first value is returned. If the attribute has no value then empty string is returned.

RegistrationMVELContextKey.idsByType=Map of identity values indexed by type.
RegistrationMVELContextKey.ridsByType=As idsByType but contain only the elements which were collected automatically.
RegistrationMVELContextKey.idsByTypeObj=Map of identity objects indexed by type. This map is harder to use then idsByType (which holds strings) but offers access to full information stored in identity as its confirmation state. 
RegistrationMVELContextKey.ridsByTypeObj=As idsByTypeObj but contain only the elements which were collected automatically. 
RegistrationMVELContextKey.attrs=Map indexed with attribute names. Value of each entry is a list of the attribute values.
RegistrationMVELContextKey.attr=Map indexed with attribute names. Value of each entry is a single value of the attribute. If the attribute is multi-valued then the first value is returned. If the attribute has no value then empty string is returned. 
RegistrationMVELContextKey.rattrs=As attrs but contain only the elements which were collected automatically.
RegistrationMVELContextKey.rattr=As attr but contain only the elements which were collected automatically.
RegistrationMVELContextKey.groups=List of selected groups.
RegistrationMVELContextKey.rgroups=As groups but contain only the elements which were collected automatically.
RegistrationMVELContextKey.status=Current request status.
RegistrationMVELContextKey.triggered= Tells how the registration was started. Available values are: manualAtLogin, manualStandalone, manualAdmin, afterRemoteLogin.
RegistrationMVELContextKey.onIdpEndpoint=If is true then the registration was invoked in the middle of authentication where Unity is being used by some service as its remote IdP. Especially useful in case of redirect action.
RegistrationMVELContextKey.userLocale=Contains the user''s locale.
RegistrationMVELContextKey.registrationForm=Name of the registration form (so it can be set in some attribute)
RegistrationMVELContextKey.requestId=Id of the registration request (so it can be set in some attribute)
RegistrationMVELContextKey.agrs=List of agreements. Each agreement is boolean type.
RegistrationMVELContextKey.validCode=true if a valid registration code was provided, false otherwise. Useful for checking if a request came by invitation or not (for forms allowing both).


OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.protocol=Name of the protocol being used.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.protocolSubtype=Name of the protocol variant.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.requester=Name of the requester.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.attr=Map indexed with principal''s attribute names. Value of each entry is a single value of the attribute. If the attribute is multi-valued then the first value is returned. If the attribute has no value then empty string is returned.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.attrs=Map indexed with attribute names. Value of each entry is a list of the attribute values.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.attrObj=Map indexed with attribute names. Value of each entry is a list of all values provided as objects with attribute-type specific contents. Useful for inspecting complex types like email and accessing its confirmation status.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.requesterAttr=As attr but contains requester attributes, if it is represented by an entity in Unity. This is the case for OAuth authentication.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.requesterAttrs=As attrs but contains requester attributes, if it is represented by an entity in Unity. This is the case for OAuth authentication.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.requesterAttrObj=As attrObj but contains requester attributes, if it is represented by an entity in Unity. This is the case for OAuth authentication.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.idsByType=Map of identity values indexed by type.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.importStatus=Map indexed with importer names which are enabled for the endpoint on which output profile is executed. Status of each importer is value of map entries. The following values are possible: notApplicable and success.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.groups= List of all groups the user is a member.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.usedGroup=Unity group from which attributes are served.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.subGroups=All sub groups of the Unity group from which attributes are served.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.groupsObj=Map indexed with names of all groups the user is a member. Value of each map entry is complete group object. See examples below for example usage examples.
OutputTranslationMVELContextKey.authenticatedWith=List of identities that were used to authenticate the user. If remote authentication was used the list contains a single identity that was used to map the remote user to the local entity (as chosen by the input translation profile). The list can have two elements when MFA was used.
